# String Art

**ðŸš§ This project is currently under construction! ðŸš§**

This app will be able to create [string art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knit_1.jpg) from arbitraty images. It will have some features that may be worth mentioning:

- support for arbitrarily many string with different thicknesses
- support for arbitrarily colored strings
- specification of more and less important regions in the image to control detail

In the end I aim to provide a web app a user can use to easily upload an image, configure settings and get a rendered result and also instructions on how to build it from real strings.
